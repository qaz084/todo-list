# Todo-list App 📝


This is a simple To-do list app, where you have an input for you to write what you need to remember to do 🤔. 

This is a practice that I've done to understand the Hook `"useReducer"` in REACT18, YARN & VITE. ⚛️

Each input is stored in the useReducer's initialState and then handled with different methods.

It has data persistence just in LocalStorage  🧠

Also in this project I've learnt how to create custom hooks and helper functions in order to ended up with a much cleaner main component.
