# Todo-list App 📝


This is a simple To-do list app, where you have an input for you to write what you need to remember to do 🤔. 

 This is a practice that I've done to understand the useReducer Hook in REACT18, YARN & VITE.

Each input is stored in the useReducer's initialState and then handled with differents methods

Also in this project I've learnt how to create custom hooks and helpers functions in order to ended up with a much cleaner main component.
